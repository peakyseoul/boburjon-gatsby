description: Some of the most important items to consider when starting up with Google Analytics 
---

The growth of the digital economy has allowed for the creation of the wide range of tools to optimize and better manage our "digital real estate" or websites. In the exciting journey of data analytics, numerous free and easy to access tools have been made available for us to utilize in managing web traffic. One of such powerful tools is Google Analytics (GA). This piece will focus on 5 must take steps that every beginner of Data Analytics should consider.

GA is one of the most popular data analytics tool in digital marketing that lets you compile a detailed data about your site. With right implementation, it will serve you quite well in making important decision about your site. However, it might be a bit overwhelming when setting it up from the get-go especially if you are the person to introduce it in your company. There is, however, a plethora of tutorials available online, but the overabundance serves it not so well as it is quite onerous to find the exact customization you need. In the Korean eCommerce environment, I have tried to boil down the practice of initializing the GA to 5 must take steps. These are not all inclusive, but might will be a good framework for the start.


1. Clean up your referral sources.

However powerful, GA will not understand what exactly you plan on analyzing and which data you find useful unless specifically outlined. Ideally, you want to accurately track which channels have higher conversion rates. Look at the referral traffic of your website and see which ones are valid and useful. It is a good practice to exclude all payment systems from referral sources from the start.

2. Exclude company IP address from tracking.

It is important that you want your data to be as clean as possible. The company traffic may disallow that since everyone is heavily involved in maintaining the site. While it may seem to be negligible at first, it may bring about wrong impressions when reporting the results of your analysis. Especially when it comes to page views of your site, report of spikes in particular pages might be wrongly attributed to a heavy maintenance taken place.

3. Objectively evaluate the accuracy of your data.

Especially, in the context of Korean digital economy, the third party payment systems like Naver pay and Kakao pay will inadvertently make your data skewed. Once users are taken outside of your site to complete the payment, it is impossible to accurately track the sales data. Therefore, be very objective in evaluating the monetary accuracy of your data. Make use of other sources of sales data at your disposal and look for patterns. In my case, it would usually come down to 2~3% margin of error. Find it out in yours and double check it periodically.

4. Remove any UTM parameters from the links within your site.

Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) parameters are widely used in digital marketing to track the efficiency of different campaigns. Be it the social media or viral channels, marketers attach UTM values for GA to analyze them. However, those links should not be used to track any in-web marketing campaigns as GA will drop the previous UTM value if the new one is detected. UTMs should only be used for external campaigns so when users land on your site, the UTM values are kept intact throughout.

5. Recognize the attribution difference between GA and other platforms.

Each paid platform that you are running your campaigns will have different attribution models. Most will try to attribute the conversion through every slightest impression. Why? It's good for business. GA, on the other hand, uses last-click attribution model by default. Be expecting different results from campaign performance data between GA and other platforms. More importantly, be ready to explain how and why.

While the focus here has been on the top 5 items, there are many more that are needed to be set up and tested to get more accurate data through GA. It is a powerful tool to analyze the traffic but not the perfect one. But as a data analyst in digital economy, I have come to realize that it is important to stay resourceful and make the best use of the tools to make data-based decisions. It is important to know its potential and understand its limitations. Be curious and ready for questions, pursue progress over perfection. Cheers!
