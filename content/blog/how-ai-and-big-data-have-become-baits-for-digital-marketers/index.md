---

Digital world has allowed us to gather more data about users than ever before. Whether you are running a simple blog or multi million dollar online store, there are a number of marketing tools available to make significant improvements about on your site. Whether you plan on selling goods or content, every decision you make could be or even must be justified based on data. Nonetheless, gathering and analyzing data is only a part of the story. Now, you will need to act based on the results of that data. While it may seem like a common sense, it is a good idea to be cautious of the potential meta-knowledge or more like the lack of thereof. Let me expand on it.

In the context of Ecommerce operations, the campaigns could be categorized into out- and in-web ones. The outer ones are campaigns implemented to bring people to your online store, while in-web campaigns focus on guiding them to buy your product. A vast number of tools are available to implement both and it is easy to find a common pattern which is all of them are filled with the most fancy words possible from AI, Big Data, to Marketing Automation. They make huge promises like skyrocketing conversion rates and "mind-blowing" user engagement through implementation of their services. It is easy to fall victim for such overhype without the knowledge of fundamentals and awareness. In other words, it behooves one to objectively evaluate their own understanding of bits and bolts before implementation. Let's clear out some those hyperbolic terms:

Big Data - is probably one of the most overused one and I have personally experienced a sales pitch when a person sales person did not fully understand it himself. Funny and very sad at the same time. Dan Ariely from Duke University explained quite well in the following:

Therefore, be cautious of your and people's understanding of Big Data and how exactly they are promising to implement it on your platform. After personally using the service X in our platform, it has become clear that they will merely give you an ability to look at the data you provide to them. That's it! And if your are not "pushing" data at large scale from your site, then it is not really a big data so to speak. So, be sure to do your homework before deciding on using their solutions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - is another of my favorite ones. There has been a trend of labeling stuff as AI if they don't understand the mechanics behind. It is a fancy word to hear, but there are always explainable digital clicks and clack behind every AI. As Enstein once said "if you cannot explain it simply, then you don't understand it well enough", be sure to use the ["five-why"]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys} technique and sprinkle it with bunch of hows before engaging into partnership.

After the first hand usage of platform X's services, I came to realize that the only time that "AI" comes into play is when the system uses the popup with higher clicks after experimenting with a few. But those different versions of the pop-up will need to be set up manually as well as the goals through which the systems will track the efficiency. Personally, I was not much impressed as it is a typical A/B test and to call it an AI is a big misnomer.

Last but not least, is about Marketing Automation. While this might be arguable for many, it is not much of an automation as long as thinking has to be done manually. In the aforementioned platform X, we have to set up all the segmentation, triggers and popup designs manually. While I am using it as an example, it is safe to assume that for the most of all such services, they are tools with great potentials but by no means are magic wands or silver bullets. You may be surprised as how this is not brought up more often but it is so since the mechanics are not revealed before you actually agree to partner with them.

As the cover says, intelligence is not about knowing everything but rather challenging what you already know. It is probably more true for those who are heavily involved in digital economy as rapid changes occur everyday. Especially if your enterprise is growing steadily, you will need to make crucial decision about allocation of your limited resources and application of tailored solutions that are right for you. There should not be black boxes that you do not fully understand, so be sure to make a habit of drinking a glass full of how's and why's for breakfast everyday. Cheers!
